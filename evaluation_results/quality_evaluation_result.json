Here\\\\u2019s why your solution works perfectly:\\\\n\\\\n### **Strengths of Your Code:**\\\\n1. **Use of `set()` for unique numbers:** You cleverly used `set()` to remove duplicates and ensure that only unique numbers are considered. This is an efficient way to address the problem requirements.\\\\n2. **Edge case handling:** By checking if `len(unique_nums) < 2`, your function correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 2 unique numbers, returning `None` as expected.\\\\n3. **Sorting:** Sorting the unique numbers in descending order (`sort(reverse=True)`) ensures that the largest numbers are easy to access, and you correctly return the second-largest number using indexing.\\\\n\\\\n### **Additional Explanation:**\\\\n- When you use `set(nums)`, you\\\\u2019re automatically removing duplicates, which simplifies the task of finding unique numbers.\\\\n- Sorting the list in reverse order (`sort(reverse=True)`) is practical for accessing the second-largest number, as Python lists allow us to grab items directly by their index (e.g., `unique_nums[1]`).\\\\n\\\\n### **Suggestions for Improvement (Tiny Tip):**\\\\nAlthough your code is excellent, here\\\\u2019s a small tip:\\\\n- Instead of sorting the list, you could find the largest and second-largest numbers using a direct comparison loop to save computational time (sorting requires `O(n log n)`, whereas finding two largest numbers directly can be done in `O(n)`). \\\\n\\\\nFor example:\\\\n```python\\\\ndef find_second_largest(nums):\\\\n    unique_nums = list(set(nums))\\\\n    if len(unique_nums) < 2:\\\\n        return None\\\\n\\\\n    largest = second_largest = float('-inf')\\\\n    for num in unique_nums:\\\\n        if num > largest:\\\\n            second_largest, largest = largest, num\\\\n        elif num > second_largest:\\\\n            second_largest = num\\\\n\\\\n    return second_largest\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis approach is slightly more optimized but requires more manual effort for comparison.\\\\n\\\\n### **Final Praise:**\\\\nYou\\\\u2019re doing incredibly well! \\\\ud83c\\\\udf89 Your ability to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps shows great programming maturity.

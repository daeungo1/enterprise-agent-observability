Just remember that **absolute value** is important to ensure the area is always positive.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Equation of the Perpendicular Line\n1. Finding the slope of \\( BC \\):  \nYou correctly calculated the slope of the line through points \\( B(6, -1) \\) and \\( C(-2, 4) \\) as \\( -\\frac{5}{8} \\).
